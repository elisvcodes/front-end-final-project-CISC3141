Overview What are you building? https://www.zoho.com/bugtracker/

Describe the bug tracker…. When a developer or a development team works on a project there are many instances when keeping track of bugs becomes difficult. A bug tracker will allow users to input information about the bugs found in their code allowing the user to track what needs to be done and keep a documentation of the process. The bug tracker will allow the user to create a bug tracker along with a description of what the bug is and update the bug tracker(whether that be changing the notes within the tracker or closing the tracker when the bug is fixed).

Who would use it? Devs….
